The *entrer:* catalogue completes the exhibition. It proposes other types of analyses of the architectural projects, which are also inspired by the idea of the “walkabout”, in the same vein as the exhibition. Five international architecture critics - Pierre Chabard, Asli Ciçek, Francesco Della Casa, Phineas Harper and Sebastian Redecke - offer their personal approach to the project in a short and substantiated text. In-depth interviews between the curator and the architecture firms give insights into their positioning, approach and specific practice. Visually, the projects are illustrated by five flipbooks that each represent a sequence of an architectural walkabout of the buildings by photographer Maxime Delvaux. A particular book form that Laure Giletti and Grégory Dapra have drawn into a dialogue with the texts in a book that is a work of art in its own right.
